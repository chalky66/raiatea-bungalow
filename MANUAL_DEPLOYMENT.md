# Manual Deployment Instructions

## The Issue
Your Codespace is having authentication issues pushing to your GitHub repository. This is common in Codespaces environments.

## The Solution: Manual Upload

### Step 1: Download Your Built Website
Your website has been successfully built! The files are ready in the `dist/` folder.

### Step 2: Manual GitHub Upload

1. **Go to your repository:** https://github.com/chalky66/raiatea-bungalow

2. **Upload the source code first:**
   - Click "uploading an existing file" or "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop these files from your Codespace:
     - All `.vue` files from `src/` folder
     - `package.json`
     - `vite.config.js`  
     - `tailwind.config.js`
     - All images from `public/img/`
     - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Commit with message: "Add source code"

3. **The GitHub Action will automatically build and deploy!**

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Source: "GitHub Actions"
3. Save

## Alternative: Direct gh-pages Upload

If the GitHub Action doesn't work, you can manually create the gh-pages branch:

1. **Create new branch in GitHub:** 
   - Go to your repo → Branches → "New branch"
   - Name: `gh-pages`

2. **Upload these built files to gh-pages branch:**
   - Switch to gh-pages branch
   - Upload files from your `dist/` folder:
     - `index.html`
     - `assets/` folder (contains CSS and JS)
     - `img/` folder (contains all property images)

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Settings → Pages
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch" 
   - Branch: `gh-pages`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
